# Nau

## Overview
A real-time GLSL renderer that visualizes a non-rotating black hole, gravitationally warped sky and a glowing accretion disk. This project is an exploration of the physics of black holes, built on the actual geodesic equations of general relativity rather than purely simulating visual effects.

## Exactness 
The light rays are traced with a simple RK4 integrator, based on the equations derived for a Schwarzschild black hole. While the underlying ray-tracing is based on actual physics, this is not a physically rigorous simulation: the RK4 integrator introduces approximation errors, and the accretion disk emission is entirely artistic rather than physically accurate. 

All the calculations can be found [here](CALCULATIONS.md)
